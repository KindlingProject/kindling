# Prometheus Metrics Description
## Service Metrics
Service metrics are generated from the server-side events, which are used to show the quality of service. 
| **Metric Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| kindling_entity_request_total | Counter | Total number of requests |
| kindling_entity_request_duration_nanoseconds_total | Counter | Total duration of requests |
| kindling_entity_request_send_bytes_total | Counter | Total size of payload sent |
| kindling_entity_request_receive_bytes_total | Counter | Total size of payload received |
| kindling_entity_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_count  | Histogram | Count of average duration of requests |
| kindling_entity_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_sum | Histogram | Sum of average duration of requests |
| kindling_entity_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_bucket | Histogram | Histogram buckets of average duration of requests |

| **Label Name** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| node | worker-1 | Node name represented in Kubernetes cluster |
| namespace | default | Namespace of the pod |
| workload_kind | daemonset | K8sResourceType |
| workload_name | api-ds | K8sResourceName |
| service | api | One of the services that target this pod |
| pod | api-ds-xxxx | The name of the pod |
| container | api-container | The name of the container |
| container_id | 1a2b3c4d5e6f | The shorten container id which contains 12 characters |
| ip | 10.1.11.23 | The IP address of the entity |
| port | 80 | The listening port of the entity |
| protocol | http | The application layer protocol the requests use |
| request_content | /test/api | The request content of the requests |
| response_content | 200 | The response content of the requests |
| is_slow | false | (Only applicable to `kindling_entity_request_total`)<br>Whether the requests are considered as slow |

**Note 1**: The label `namespace` holds a value `NOT_FOUND_INTERNAL` when the `container_id` and the IP can't be found in the current Kubernetes cluster, in which case the entity isn't maintained by the current Kubernetes.

**Note 2**: The labels `request_content` and `response_content` hold different values when `protocol` is different.

- When protocol is http:
  
| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| request_content | /test/api | Endpoint of HTTP request. URL has been truncated to avoid high-cardinality. |
| response_content | 200 | 'Status Code' of HTTP response. |

- When protocol is dns:
  
| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| request_content | www.google.com | Domain to be queried |
| response_content | 0 | "rcode" of DNS response. Including 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 |

- When protocol is mysql:
  
| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| request_content | select employee | SQL of MySQL. SQL has been truncated to avoid high-cardinality. The format is ['operation' 'space' 'table']. |
| response_content |  | Empty temporarily. |

- When protocol is kafka:
  
| **Label** | **Example** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| request_content | user-msg-topic | Topic of Kafka request. |
| response_content |  | Empty temporarily. |

- When protocol is dubbo:

| **Label** | **Example**                   | **Notes**                           |
| --- |-------------------------|--------------------------|
| request_content | io.kindling.dubbo.api.service.OrderService#order | Service Info. The format of service is `package.class#method`                                                                                            |
| response_content | 20                                               | "error_code" of Dubbo, 20 - OK, more details at `https://dubbo.apache.org/en/blog/2018/10/05/introduction-to-the-dubbo-protocol/#dubbo-protocol-details` |

- For other cases, the `request_content` and `response_content` are both empty.

## Topology Metrics

Topology metrics are typically generated from the client-side events, which are used to show the service dependencies map, so the metrics are called "topology". Some timeseries may be generated from the server-side events, which contain a non-empty label `dst_container_id`. These timeseries are generated only when the source IP is not the pod's IP inside the Kubernetes cluster, which are useful when there is no agent installed on the client-side. 

| **Metric Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| kindling_topology_request_total | Counter | Total number of requests |
| kindling_topology_request_duration_nanoseconds_total | Counter |  Total duration of requests |
| kindling_topology_request_request_bytes_total | Counter | Total size of payload sent |
| kindling_topology_request_response_bytes_total | Counter | Total size of payload received |
| kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_count | Histogram | Count of average duration of requests |​
| kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_sum | Histogram | Sum of average duration of requests  |
| kindling_topology_request_average_duration_nanoseconds_bucket | Histogram | Histogram buckets of average duration of requests |

| src_namespace | default | Namespace of the source pod |
| src_workload_kind | deployment | Workload kind of the source pod |
| src_workload_name | business1 | Workload name of the source pod |
| src_service | business1-svc | One of the services that target the source pod |
| src_pod | business1-0 | The name of the source pod |
| src_container | business-container | The name of the source container |
| src_container_id | 1a2b3c4d5e6f | The shorten container id which contains 12 characters |
| src_ip | 10.1.11.23 | The IP address of the source |
| dst_node | slave-node2 | Which node the destination pod is on |
| dst_namespace | default | Namespace of the destination pod |
| dst_workload_kind | deployment | Workload kind of the destination pod |
| dst_workload_name | business2 | Workload name of the destination pod |
| dst_service | business2-svc | One of the services that target the destination pod |
| dst_pod | business2-0 | The name of the destination pod |
| dst_container | business-container | The name of the source container |
| dst_container_id | 2b3c4d5e6f7e | (Only applicable to the timeseries generated from the server-side)<br>The shorten container id which contains 12 characters |
| dst_ip | 10.1.11.24 | The IP address of the destination |
| dst_port | 80 | The listening port of the destination container  |
| protocol | http | The application layer protocol the requests use |
| status_code | 200 | Different values for different protocols  |

**Note 1**: We define two custom terms for the label `src_namespace` and `dst_namespace`, which are `NOT_FOUND_INTERNAL` and `NOT_FOUND_EXTERNAL`. The meanings are described as follows. These terms also apply to other metrics in this doc.

These two terms are composed of two parts.
1. **NOT_FOUND**: `NOT_FOUND` means the IP is neither a pod's one nor a service's one in the current Kubernetes cluster. The IP could belong to a host or an external service. 
2. **INTERNAL or EXTERNAL**: There are two cases in which `INTERNAL` will be set. The first case is when the IP belongs to a node that resides in the current Kubernetes cluster. The second case is when the `source` or `destination` is running on the same host with the kindling agent, which is generally applicable for non-Kubernetes clusters. `EXTERNAL` is set for other cases if the IP is `NOT_FOUND`. Note another Kubernetes cluster is also considered "external".

**Note 2**: The field "status_code" holds different values when "protocol" is different.

- HTTP: 'Status Code' of HTTP response. 
- DNS: rcode of DNS response.
- DUBBO: 'Error Code' of Dubbo request.
- others: empty temporarily.

## Trace As Metric
We made some rules for considering whether a request is abnormal. For the abnormal request, the detail request information is considered as useful for debugging or profiling. We name this kind of data "trace". It is not a good practice to store such data in Prometheus as some labels are high-cardinality, so we picked up some labels from the original ones to generate a new kind of metric, which is called "Trace As Metric". The following table shows what labels this metric contains.  

| **Metric Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
